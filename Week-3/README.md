# Effect of noise in Data fitting
- In Week-3 of the course, The relationship between noise in data and the error in linear fit estimates are studied.
- We focus only on independant normally distributed noise samples, and attempt to fit them using Least squares method.
- Do take a look at the [Report](https://github.com/HR-1-1/EE2703/blob/main/Week-3/Report/main.tex) to get insights on the outcomings of this excercise.
