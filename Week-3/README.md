# Effect of noise in Data fitting
- In Week-3 of the course, The relationship between noise in data and the error in linear fit estimates are studied.
- We focus only on independant normally distributed noise samples, and attempt to fit them using Least squares method.
- Do take a look at the [Report](insert-link) to get insights on the outcomings of this excercise.
